Description:

An NBA game runs 48 minutes (Four 12 minute quarters). Players do not typically play the full game, subbing in and out as necessary. Your job is to extrapolate a player's points per game if they played the full 48 minutes.

Write a function that takes two arguments, ppg (points per game) and mpg (minutes per game) and returns a straight extrapolation of ppg per 48 minutes rounded to the nearest tenth. Return 0 if 0.

Examples:

pointsPer48(12, 20) // 28.8
pointsPer48(10, 10) // 48 
pointsPer48(5, 17) // 14.1 
pointsPer48(0, 0) // 0

Notes:
All inputs will be either be an integer or float.
Follow your dreams!

function pointsPer48(ppg, mpg) {
  const GAME_TIME = 48;

  return mpg === 0 ? 0 : +((GAME_TIME * ppg) / mpg).toFixed(1);

  //   return +((GAME_TIME * ppg) / mpg).toFixed(1) || 0;
}

console.log(pointsPer48(12, 20)); //28.8
console.log(pointsPer48(10, 10)); //48.0
console.log(pointsPer48(5, 17)); //14.1
console.log(pointsPer48(0, 0)); //0
console.log(pointsPer48(30.8, 34.7)); //42.6
console.log(pointsPer48(22.9, 33.8)); //32.5
